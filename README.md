# Melos Build Runner GitHub Action

A GitHub Action to automate and optimize the [Melos Build Runner](https://pub.dev/packages/melos) for Dart and Flutter projects. This action runs the build runner across your packages and caches the outputs to speed up subsequent runs.

## Features

- **Automated Build Runner Execution**: Streamlines the process of running the build runner in multi-package repositories managed by Melos.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Caches generated files to minimize redundant builds, improving overall CI/CD pipeline efficiency.
- **Customizable Build Commands**: Allows you to specify custom build runner commands as needed for your project.
